# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the hydration mismatch error occurring in the theme toggle component. The error happens because the server-side rendered HTML doesn't match the client-side rendered HTML due to theme state being unavailable during server-side rendering. This creates a poor user experience with console errors and potential layout shifts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme toggle to render consistently between server and client, so that I don't experience hydration errors or visual glitches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the theme toggle SHALL render without hydration mismatch errors
2. WHEN the server renders the component THEN it SHALL use a safe default state that matches the client's initial render
3. WHEN the client hydrates THEN the theme toggle SHALL smoothly transition to the correct theme state without visual jumps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the theme system to be hydration-safe, so that the application maintains performance and doesn't show console errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component mounts on the client THEN it SHALL detect the actual theme preference without causing hydration mismatches
2. WHEN the theme state is unknown during SSR THEN the component SHALL render in a neutral state
3. WHEN the client-side JavaScript loads THEN it SHALL update the theme toggle to reflect the actual theme preference

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme toggle to work reliably across page refreshes and navigation, so that my theme preference is consistently applied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I refresh the page THEN the theme toggle SHALL show the correct theme state after hydration completes
2. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN the theme toggle SHALL maintain consistent behavior without hydration errors
3. WHEN the theme preference changes THEN the toggle SHALL update immediately and persist the preference

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the solution to be reusable, so that other components can safely access theme state without hydration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN other components need theme information THEN they SHALL be able to access it through a hydration-safe pattern
2. WHEN implementing theme-dependent rendering THEN components SHALL have access to utilities that prevent hydration mismatches
3. WHEN the theme system is used THEN it SHALL provide clear patterns for avoiding server/client rendering differences
