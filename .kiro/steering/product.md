# Product Overview

SalesMatter is an AI-driven sales automation platform that streamlines outbound sales workflows. The application enables users to:

- Import leads via CSV upload with AI-powered column mapping
- Enrich lead data using GPT-4o web research (LinkedIn URLs, insight summaries)
- Generate personalized email drafts using AI (Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI/Anthropic)
- Review and approve emails with inline editing
- Simulate batch email sending with scheduling and analytics
- Track campaign performance with basic KPIs and charts

The platform supports multi-tenancy with company-based workspaces, user authentication via Clerk, and data persistence through Supabase. The UI emphasizes a streamlined workflow: Import → Enrich → Generate → Review → Send → Analytics.

Key capabilities are demonstration-focused: CRM connections, enrichment providers, and SMTP sending are UI mockups. The core AI features (CSV mapping, lead research, email generation) are fully functional.
