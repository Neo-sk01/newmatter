# CSV Import Debug & Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Type Safety Issues in `/api/parse-csv` Route**
**Problem:** The code was trying to access properties on `Record<string, unknown>` type without proper type casting, which could cause runtime errors and prevent leads from being processed correctly.

**Fixed:**
- Line 414-416: Added type-safe custom field assignment
- Line 425-426: Added type guard for fullName splitting
- Line 436-461: Added type guards for email validation
- Line 469-480: Added type guards for URL normalization

### 2. **Insufficient Logging**
**Problem:** When the import failed, there was no clear indication of where the failure occurred or what data was being processed.

**Fixed:**
- Added comprehensive console logging throughout the CSV import flow
- Added logging for:
  - Parse result status and lead counts
  - Fallback activation reasons
  - Result state when rendering
  - Import button clicks
  - Lead data before passing to parent component

### 3. **Missing Visual Feedback**
**Problem:** Users couldn't see if leads were actually parsed before clicking the import button.

**Fixed:**
- Added a "Lead Preview" table in the results screen showing the first 5 leads
- Displays: Name, Email, Company, Title for each lead
- Shows count of additional leads if more than 5

## How to Test

### Test 1: Basic CSV Import (csv-demo page)
1. Navigate to `/csv-demo`
2. Upload a CSV file with lead data
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Watch for console logs:
   - "API response status: 200"
   - "Parse result success: true"
   - "Parse result leads count: X"
   - "Setting main parse result, leads count: X"
5. Check that the results screen shows:
   - Valid lead count
   - Quality metrics
   - Column mapping
   - **NEW:** Lead Preview table with actual lead data
6. Click "Import X Leads" button
7. Verify console shows:
   - "handleImport called"
   - "Calling onImportComplete with X leads"
   - First 3 leads logged
8. Verify the "Imported Leads Preview" table appears below with your leads

### Test 2: With OpenAI API Key
If you have OpenAI API configured:
1. Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is in your `.env.local`
2. Upload CSV with varied column names (e.g., "First Name", "fname", "Email Address")
3. Check console for AI mapping results
4. Verify the "Column Mapping" section shows intelligent mappings

### Test 3: Fallback Mode (without OpenAI)
1. Remove or comment out `OPENAI_API_KEY` from `.env.local`
2. Restart the dev server
3. Upload a CSV
4. Console should show:
   - "Enhanced AI parsing unavailable, using fallback parser"
   - "Fallback reason: { ... }"
   - "Fallback result leads count: X"
5. Verify leads still import correctly using fallback logic

### Test 4: Empty or Invalid Data
1. Upload a CSV with some rows missing emails
2. Check that:
   - Errors are reported in the UI
   - Valid leads are still processed
   - Email validation stats are accurate

### Test 5: Custom Fields
1. Upload a CSV with non-standard columns (e.g., "Customer ID", "Source", "Notes")
2. Verify custom fields are detected and shown in the UI
3. Check that custom fields are preserved in the imported leads

## Sample Test CSV

Create a file `test-import.csv`:

```csv
First Name,Last Name,Email,Company Name,Job Title,Website
John,Doe,john.doe@acme.com,Acme Corp,CEO,acme.com
Jane,Smith,jane@example.com,Example Inc,CTO,example.com
Bob,Johnson,bob.johnson@test.io,Test LLC,Developer,test.io
Alice,Williams,alice@sample.com,Sample Co,Manager,sample.com
```

## Expected Console Output

When everything works correctly, you should see:

```
Sending CSV data to /api/parse-csv {columnCount: 6, rowCount: 4, columns: Array(6)}
API response status: 200 OK
Parse result: {success: true, totalRows: 4, validRows: 4, ...}
Parse result leads count: 4
Parse result success: true
Setting main parse result, leads count: 4
Rendering results step
result object: {success: true, totalRows: 4, validRows: 4, ...}
result.leads array: Array(4)
result.leads.length: 4
[User clicks Import button]
handleImport called
result: {success: true, totalRows: 4, validRows: 4, ...}
result.leads: Array(4)
result.leads.length: 4
Calling onImportComplete with 4 leads
First 3 leads: [{id: "...", firstName: "John", ...}, ...]
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Parse result leads count: 0"
**Cause:** CSV data structure issue or all rows being filtered out
**Solution:** Check your CSV has valid data and proper headers

### Issue: Fallback mode activated unexpectedly
**Cause:** OpenAI API key missing or invalid
**Solution:** Check `.env.local` has valid `OPENAI_API_KEY`

### Issue: Import button doesn't do anything
**Cause:** `result.leads` is empty or undefined
**Solution:** Check console logs to see where leads are lost in the pipeline

### Issue: Type errors in console
**Cause:** Lead data structure mismatch
**Solution:** The fixes in this update should resolve these

## Files Modified

1. `/src/app/api/parse-csv/route.ts` - Fixed type safety issues
2. `/src/components/EnhancedCSVImporter.tsx` - Added logging and preview table
3. Created this debug guide

## Next Steps

If issues persist after these fixes:
1. Share the full console output
2. Share a sample of your CSV file structure
3. Check Network tab for the `/api/parse-csv` response body
4. Verify the parent component's `onImportComplete` callback is working correctly
